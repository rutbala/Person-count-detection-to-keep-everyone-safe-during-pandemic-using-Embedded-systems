# Person-count-detection-using-Embedded-systems | Arduino IDE, Arduino Nano, Embedded C

Introduction:-

This project proposes a hardware-based solution to manage crowd control and maintain social distancing in public places like malls, universities, and offices using Arduino and sensors. The system uses infrared or ultrasonic sensors to count the number of people entering and exiting a location in real-time. The data is processed by an Arduino microcontroller, which triggers a buzzer alarm if the count exceeds the predefined limit, ensuring adherence to social distancing guidelines. This approach helps prevent overcrowding and enhances safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
